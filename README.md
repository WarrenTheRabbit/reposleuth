# reposleuth
A tool for visualising, summarising, learning about and engaging with Python repositories. 

#### Purpose
##### A tool in my tookit
Primarily, this repository has been created to support the efforts of my repository [pytest-onboarding](https://github.com/WarrenTheRabbit/pytest-onboarding/blob/main/README.md), which is a work in progress for contributing 'contributor case studies' and documentation to [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/).

##### A *How To* for other junior devs  
A close secondary goal is to create a kind of 'partially explained play-by-play' that a junior dev could use to see how someone else has gone about creating a real and permanent tool for their toolkit in a 'semi-professional way'. You are welcome to code along, base different efforts on it, skim through sections or sing the entire contents of the repository to a metronome if that is best for you; however it is you want to use this repository, wonderful, it is here to be used. You have my fullest blessings and you can reach out to me here or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/warrenmarkham/); if I know how to help, I will.

###### The original hope
My original hope, however, is that if I document the steps I take to create something that is *whole, meaningful, extendable and usable* then it might help you take such steps of your own. 

I am a career changer and what I have noticed in myself is that I can't be satisfied with a fragmented experience of 'doing programming' - the disjointed jigsaw of participation and knowledge that comes from going from one tutorial, video or article to another. If I leave things at that, I get depressed, feel disconnected from myself and flounder like one who is lost. For my programming journey to be true to who I am and what I need, it must have the stuff of life in it. It is not enough to just have the smouldering line of a sunrise filling me with temporary morning awe.

That is, I need more than tutorials' tiny mornings. What I need is to engage with programming in the same way I (imperfectly) try to engage myself as father to a dependent and romantic partner to an equal: as *being for*, *going to* and *staying with*. The investing, committing and caring - the full and beautiful daylight that makes life worth living. Shining yourself into it as the commitment to not turn away when things are hard and the willingness to create something and be present. Maybe you need the same. Or maybe you don't. Either way, I hope that by expressing my own needs, and discussing things throughout this readme in such an unorthodox way, that it helps you more deeply understand and turn towards your own.


#### What to build?
My advice would be to ask: 'What tool would help me act on my values more effectively in the world?'. Then try to build some small part of what the answer is, and continue to grow the tool you are building as long as it feels relevant and connected to your current situation. Meanwhile, document your progress and reflect on the things you learn; in many ways, you are your own greatest teacher - your *only* teacher - and it is empowering to remember that. 

Just as with learning guitar, riding a bike or indeed dying, so too with learning to be a professional programmer; there is no one else who can take your place and go through those things for you. If someone else does, then *they* are the ones that do whatever it is that is done when a person dies, who learns how to program or who learns to ride a bike. But someone else doesn't need to do it for you; *you* can choose to be the person that learns to program. 

Learning to program is what happens when *you* program. Not when you dabble or dart or flit across things; you learn when you get *involved*. You actually have a superpower - you learn what you involve yourself in. So have gratitude to yourself, your amazing, capacious and magical self, whose greatness is that it gifts you everything you will ever need when you decide to always participate, always take responsibility, always connect and always be involved. Build, care, turn up and learn to program. 

#### The morning light
The morning light certaily catches my attention. Without doubt, programming thrills me still; it is beautiful and breathtaking. Can you think on all that must have come before in human history for the state of programming to be where it is at right now without feeling amazement and wonder? I can't. I get the biggest feels from visualising large-scale, extended-through-time collaborations; from thinking on how it might make each person-link in the chain feel if they could step out of their part of the chain momentarily to see everyone, to talk to everyone, and to have a chance to share with each other how important it is and how much it means to them to be a part of it. But fancies and morning are not reality and a full day. We can certainly enjoy the morning when it is morning; but better still to enjoy how you get out and about across an entire day.

#### Final Words
I wish you the very best and encourage you to be liberated of all worry. No one is special; so take off all such cruel yokes that make you doubt, compare or fear. You need not spend a single moment more wondering about whether or not you are good enough. You need not figure out whether you are unemployed, or employed at a particular salary, or in a certain industry, because someone knows the truth about your real worth and limits. You are and have everything you need already: the ability to choose and commit. So do not think about what level you need to reach and do not think about what prohibits you from entry. Simply care, take responsibility, build and throw yourself wholeheartedly forward through time and into encounters with other people.

Ultimately, I want to salute you for choosing to be the one who turns up to learn how to program; whether that is here, elsewhere, this way or in another way, and regardless of how it is done or what it looks like, it must always be you who does it and no other. That is why I salute you. In fact, I hold that part of you and that part of myself in the highest esteem. I'll sign off with a reminder to myself and hopefully with something you find inspiring: for even though we can know for sure that we are not at all special, we can be just as confident that every choice to turn up and care will without fail create something that is. 

Warren
