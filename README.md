# reposleuth
WIP. A tool for visualising, summarising, learning about and engaging with Python repositories. 

#### Purpose
##### A tool in my tookit
Primarily, this repository has been created to support the efforts of my repository [pytest-onboarding](https://github.com/WarrenTheRabbit/pytest-onboarding/blob/main/README.md), which is a *very* early stage WIP for contributing 'contributor case studies' and documentation to [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/).

##### A *How To* for other junior devs  
A close secondary goal is to create a kind of 'partially explained play-by-play' that a junior dev could use to see how someone else has gone about creating a real and permanent tool for their toolkit in a 'semi-professional way'. You are welcome to code along, base different efforts on it, skim through sections or sing the entire contents of the repository to a metronome if that is best for you. 

However it is you want to use this repository, wonderful, it is here to be used. You have my fullest blessings and you can reach out to me here or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/warrenmarkham/); if I know how to help, I will.

###### The original hope
My original hope, however, was this: if I document the steps I take to create something that is *whole, meaningful, extensible and usable* then it might help *you* take such steps of your own. 

The reason it is important that *I* take such steps is because I am a career changer. Or maybe that doesn't matter. But I sometimes thing it does. I've been through school. I've fallen in love. I've had my heartbroken. Friends and pets have died. I've had failures. I've had outstanding successes. I've cared unreasonably about the opinions of others. I've suffered in most of the ways that a person can make themselves suffer. I've lied to myself, shamed myself, silenced myself and refused myself compassion and forgiveness. I've been through a lot of experiences. I've learned it is wise to go placidly amidst praise and blame. I've learned it is wise to travel a real path - *your* path - instead of trying to become someone else on a well-laid path. So an A+, an F, Udemy telling me I have completed such and such a course? They are shooting stars in a sky that life has shown me is very big. They don't have zip and zing. They aren't as real, do not appear as big, as such things once did. But the feelings of my partner feels real. My choice to be vegan does. Helping someone feels real. Getting up in the morning and going to bed feeling like I did something does. Is that maturity? Maybe it is. Maybe that is why being a career changer matters. 

Regardless, something I've noticed about myself is that I don't feel satisfied when I go for a fragmented experience of 'doing programming' day in and day out. For me, for my well-being and continued growth, I need to stay connected to all the things that matter to me. That is, if I allow a strange mini world of activities to replace the big sky I've seen and care about, I start to feel depressed, disconnected from myself and flounder about like one who is lost. Quite simply, I can't endlessly do tutorials, courses or videos. I need real projects, real people to engage with and reasons for writing code that go beyond 'making myself feel like I have such-and-such a skill'. The disjointed jigsaw of half-participation and half-knowledge that happens when I go from one tutorial, course or video to another has little in common with the things that I know bring out the best in me: caring, taking responsibility and working with others. 

For my programming journey to be true to who I am and what I need, it must have the stuff of life in it. Tutorials *can* be nice. There are lots of wonderful, effective communicators out there; I can, have and will continue to benefit from their passion, hard work and good intentions. But once you know about the warmth of the sun, it is not enough to experience just the thin line of colour you can see at sunrise. As interesting as tutorials, books and courses are, they do not compare to lending someone a hand or overcoming a current limit in how effectively you can act on your values. 

I feel I have learned this lesson many times over: brief things grow no fruit. For me, I need to engage with programming in the same way I try to engage myself as father to a dependent or as romantic partner to an equal: as a  *being for*, a *going to* and a *staying with*. All that investing, committing and caring - that full and beautiful daylight that makes life worth living. Shining yourself into the life you live with the commitment to not turn away when things are hard and as the willingness to create something, maintain and renew it, and to be present. I'm writing this because maybe you need the same and you just haven't said it to yourself yet. Or maybe you don't. Either way, I hope that by expressing my own needs, and discussing things throughout this readme in such an unorthodox and flowery way, that it helps you overhear yourself and turn towards your own needs. 

Yet I can't help but think that there must be others like me. Living a life has changed me. If you are a career changer, I wonder if living a life has changed you in similar ways too. I'm hoping this repository can help people with similar feelings to the ones I have just shared find a new direction for their programming journey - a direction they are desperately needing. To have some chance of helping other people like me, I'm going to share the process of creating a project that is real, usable, able to grow with me, that has relevance from the very beginning, and which is something I actually care about.


#### What to build?
Let's say you are onboard with the idea but you don't know what to build. My advice would be to ask yourself: 'What tool would help me act on my values more effectively in the world?'. Then try to build some small part of whatever the answer is, and continue to grow the tool you are building as long as it feels relevant and connected to your values and situation. Meanwhile, document your progress and reflect on the things you learn; in many ways, you are your own greatest teacher - your *only* teacher - and it is empowering to remember that. 

#### You can learn
Just as with learning guitar, riding a bike or indeed dying, so too with learning to be a professional programmer; there is no one else who can take your place and go through those things for you. If someone else *does* somehow go through those experiences for you, then *they* are the ones who will do whatever it is that is done when a person dies, who will learn to program and who will learn to ride a bike. It certainly won't be you. Yet you don't need someone else to do it for you; *you* can be the person that learns to program. 

After all, learning to program is what happens to you when *you* program. It doesn't happen when you dabble or dart or flit across things; you learn when you get *involved*. Indeed, you have an incredible superpower - you will learn whatever it is you get yourself involved in. I think that is just fanstatic. I encourage you to have gratitude towards yourself - your amazing, capacious and magical self - because you are always standing in the wings ready to give yourself gifts. Incredible gifts. You gift yourself everything you will ever need when you make the decision to always participate, always take responsibility, always connect and always be involved. So build, care, turn up and learn to program. 

#### Final Words
I wish you the very best and encourage you to be liberated of all worry. No one is special; so take off all such cruel yokes. There is enough noise in the world already. Don't bother with things that make you doubt, compare or fear. You don't need to spend a single moment more wondering about whether or not you are good enough. You don't need to figure out whether you are unemployed, or employed at a particular salary, or in a certain industry, because someone knows the truth about your real worth and limits. You are and have everything you need already: the ability to choose and commit. There is no point thinking about what level you need to reach or what you believe excludes you from entry. Simply care, take responsibility, build and throw yourself wholeheartedly forward through time and into encounters with other people. That is how we become programmers.

Ultimately, I want to salute you for choosing to be the one who turns up to learn how to program; whether some of that learning happens here, elsewhere, this way or in another way, it will always be you who is doing it. That is why I salute you. In fact, I hold that part of you and that part of myself in the highest esteem. I'll sign off with a reminder to myself and hopefully with something you find inspiring: even though we can know for sure that we are not at all special, we can be just as confident that every choice to turn up and care will without fail create something that is. 

Warren
